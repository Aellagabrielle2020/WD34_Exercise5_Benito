The construction site is positioned adjacent to the main Venetian tower and is near a fifteen-story building with two basement levels. The foremost scope of works consisted of a diaphragm wall with ground anchors. In spite of that, the secant pile wall was planned and designed by BAUER Foundations Philippines, Inc. to be able to accomplish the shoring from a few different elevations and to account for a number of corners and curved alignments of the wall, contemplating that it is placed near the mall boundary line.

        As a result, four hundred fifty-two secant piles with 880-millimeter diameter were built using different kinds of drilling rigs, to serve as a pile wall for maintaining structure. Furthermore, BAUER Foundations Philippines, Inc. was in charge of installing 550 ground anchors as well as the construction of various beams. The construction floor area is 77,355 square meters and it has three floors. The type of construction service was civil, architectural, structural, waterproofing, and painting job.
